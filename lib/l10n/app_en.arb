  "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faqDescription": "Find answers to common questions about Vyra and how to use our features effectively.",
  
  "faqOne": "What is VYRA?",
  "faqOneAnswer": "VYRA is a mobile app that helps people navigate the healthiest routes in their cities by combining NASA's Earth observation data with local street networks. It visualizes environmental stress (temperature, air quality, rain) and suggests routes or actions that reduce exposure.",
  
  "faqTwo": "What problem does VYRA solve?",
  "faqTwoAnswer": "Urban residents are often unaware of micro-climate variations — heat pockets, polluted zones, or poor air flow. VYRA makes these invisible health risks visible and actionable, empowering people to make better mobility and planning decisions.",
  
  "faqThree": "What data does VYRA use?",
  "faqThreeAnswer": "It integrates NASA and open datasets, such as: ERA5 (temperature, wind) for thermal stress, Sentinel-5P or MAIAC for air quality, GPM IMERG for rain and humidity, and SEDAC GPWv4 for population density. All combined into a simple Health Stress Index (HSI).",
  
  "faqFour": "How does VYRA calculate 'healthiest' routes?",
  "faqFourAnswer": "For every street segment, VYRA samples nearby data layers (heat, air, rain), computes a weighted exposure score, and compares two options: Fastest route — shortest distance or time, and Healthiest route — slightly longer but lower environmental stress. Users can see the difference in both exposure % and travel time.",
  
  "faqFive": "Does VYRA work in real time?",
  "faqFiveAnswer": "Yes — it refreshes environmental layers hourly using NASA's near-real-time products (e.g., GPM IMERG and ERA5-Land). If live data is unavailable, it falls back to cached or demo datasets, so it's always usable even offline.",
  
  "faqSix": "What is the Health Stress Index (HSI)?",
  "faqSixAnswer": "HSI is a composite value (0–10) that represents combined thermal, air, and rain stress at a given point or neighborhood. For example: HSI 2–4 = comfortable, HSI 5–7 = moderate stress, HSI 8+ = high health risk area.",
  
  "faqSeven": "How can city planners use VYRA?",
  "faqSevenAnswer": "Through the Planner Simulation feature — users can 'add trees' or 'increase green cover' on the map to instantly see how that would reduce the average HSI and benefit local populations. This turns abstract climate metrics into visual, actionable urban planning tools.",
  
  "faqEight": "Why NASA data?",
  "faqEightAnswer": "NASA's Earth observation datasets offer global, validated, and openly accessible measurements of environmental parameters. They ensure scientific reliability and scalability to any city in the world without needing expensive local sensors.",
  
  "faqNine": "How is VYRA different from other navigation apps?",
  "faqNineAnswer": "Unlike Google Maps or Waze, VYRA is not about traffic or speed — it's about human health and environmental comfort. It's the first routing tool that blends space data, sustainability, and personal well-being into everyday movement.",
  
  "faqTen": "What's next for VYRA after the hackathon?",
  "faqTenAnswer": "Expand beyond Istanbul to multiple cities, integrate AI explainers ('why this route is healthier'), add user personas (e.g., asthma, elderly, cyclist), and connect with city dashboards to support climate-resilient urban planning.",
